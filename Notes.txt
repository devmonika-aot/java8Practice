1) Sorting using Comparator and Comparable.
    Comparable:
       We implements Comparable on POJO and override method compareTo() to implement sorting logic.
       To call compareTo(), when we use Collections.sort(List<PoJo>), It will call compare to sorting.
    Comparator:
       Comparator is Function Interface which has only one abstract method compare().
       So we can implement sorting logic using lambda expression as It has only one abstract method.
2)  Lis of Functional Interface which can be used for lambda expression:
        Comparator(compare())
        Comparable(compareTo())
        Runnable(run())
