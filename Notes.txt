//Different way to creating Stream.
    1) From Arrays
    2) From List
    3) From String
    4) From  builder
// Intermediate Operations
    1) Difference between Map and FlatMap
    Stream.flatMap, as it can be guessed by its name, is the combination of a map and a flat operation.
    That means that you first apply a function to your elements, and then flatten it. Stream.map
    only applies a function to the stream without flattening the stream.
    flatmap = map + flatern
    To understand what flattening a stream consists in, consider a structure like [ [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9] ]
    which has "two levels". Flattening this means transforming it in a "one level"
    structure : [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ]

    2) Diff between Map and Filter.
    Map: produces stream which is only passes inside map()
    e.g map(e -> e.getNames()), only List<String> of Name will be produce.
    Filter: produces stream of whole data object passes through filter().
    e.g filter(e->e.startWith("S)", It will produce List<Student>

// Terminal Operations



//Parallel Stream and flatmap
